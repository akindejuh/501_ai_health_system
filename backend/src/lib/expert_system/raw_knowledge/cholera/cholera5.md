This fifth logic layer for your cholera knowledge engine identifies remaining technical parameters and operational logic from the sources, focusing on **infectious dose thresholds**, **advanced water quality engineering**, **chemical degradation logistics**, and **differential re-evaluation protocols**.

### I. Layer 17: Ingestion Dynamics and Pathogen Exposure
This layer defines the logical relationship between the vehicle of transmission and the infectious dose required to manifest disease.

*   **Infectious Dose Logic (Vehicle Dependent):**
    *   **IF** Pathogen is ingested with **Water** $\rightarrow$ Required dose is **$10^3$ to $10^8$ CFU**.
    *   **IF** Pathogen is ingested with **Food** $\rightarrow$ Required dose is lower (**~$10^2$ to $10^4$ CFU**) due to the buffering effect of food against gastric acid.
*   **Host Susceptibility Multiplier:**
    *   **IF** Patient has **hypochlorhydria** (low gastric acid) $\rightarrow$ Inoculum as low as **$10^5$ CFU** can trigger severe disease in water-based transmission.

### II. Layer 18: Advanced Water Engineering and Logistics
This layer provides specific engineering targets for water safety and facility maintenance within a Cholera Treatment Centre (CTC).

*   **Water Quality Compliance (Potable Target):**
    *   **Turbidity Rule:** Water for consumption MUST have turbidity **less than 5 NTU**.
    *   **Residual Chlorine Rule:** Maintain a free residual chlorine level of **0.5 – 1.0 mg/L**; test quality regularly.
*   **Material Science Logic (Corrosion Prevention):**
    *   **Furniture Rule:** Use **wooden beds** or chemically treated epoxy-coated surfaces; avoid standard metal as chlorine solutions are highly corrosive to metallic surfaces.
    *   **Plumbing Rule:** Use **PVC or Polypropylene (PP)** pipes and junctions; do not use metal for the chlorinated water distribution system.
*   **Latrine Logistics (Population Ratios):**
    *   **Triage/Recovery Zone:** Maintain **1 latrine per 20** patients or caregivers.
    *   **In-Patient Zone:** Maintain **1 latrine per 50** patients.

### III. Layer 19: Operational Sanitation and Chemical Stability
This layer governs the maintenance of disinfectants and the cleaning of high-risk operational equipment.

*   **Chemical Degradation Monitoring:**
    *   **Calcium Hypochlorite (HTH 70%):** Predict a loss of approximately **2% of active chlorine per year**; adjust stock rotation accordingly.
    *   **Chlorinated Lime (30%):** Logic: Unstable; MUST be used within **3 months of manufacture** if stored in good conditions.
*   **Operational Disinfection Protocols:**
    *   **Ambulance Rule:** Upon arrival and confirmation of patient admission, the ambulance driver MUST wash down the vehicle with center-provided chlorine solutions before departing.
    *   **Staff Uniform Rule:** Immerse uniforms for **10 minutes in 0.05% chlorine** solution, then rinse and wash as usual.
    *   **Kitchen Protocol:** Food from relatives MUST be transferred to the center's sanitized containers at the gate; relatives' containers are excluded from the red zone.

### IV. Layer 20: Diagnostic Re-evaluation and Immunology
This layer provides recursive logic for managing diagnostic uncertainty and vaccine schedules.

*   **Differential Re-evaluation Rule (Persistent Fever):**
    *   **Condition:** Treatment for suspected malaria has been initiated.
    *   **Rule:** IF fever persists **$>48$ hours** $\rightarrow$ Re-evaluate for **Typhoid or Dengue co-infection**; co-infection rates range from 3.9% to 6.7% in endemic zones.
*   **Advanced OCV Booster Logic:**
    *   **Interval Rule:** IF a child received a single OCV dose **3 years prior** $\rightarrow$ Administering one booster dose significantly augments the vibriocidal antibody response compared to OCV-naive individuals.
*   **Vomiting and ORS Timing:**
    *   **Action:** IF the patient vomits during oral rehydration $\rightarrow$ Wait **10 minutes** before resuming ORS; then resume giving solution more slowly.

### V. Layer 21: Case Performance and System Integrity
This layer defines the validation and accuracy targets for a cholera knowledge engine.

*   **System Accuracy Benchmarking:**
    *   **Validation Rule:** Use the **K. Cohen method** (Kappa index) to measure agreement between system recommendations and expert doctors; target a **Kappa index $\approx 0.82$** for "almost perfect" agreement.
    *   **Incomplete Data Logic:** The inference engine MUST handle the "sparseness of response" by the patient, prioritizing objective physical signs over subjective reported symptoms.
