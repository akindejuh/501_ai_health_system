This seventh logic tree for malaria integrates **quantitative probability equations**, **convulsion management pharmacology**, **advanced overlap symptom weights**, and **computational inference methods** (specifically RSS) found in the sources.

### **I. Quantitative Certainty Logic (Layer 1)**
*   **A. The Probability Equation Rule**
    *   **Logic Rule:** Calculate the specific probability of malaria ($P$) using the weighted symptom formula:
        $$P = \frac{(\Sigma S_i \times W_i - \Sigma(S_{major})_j(W_{max})_j) - Min_{th}}{Max_{th} - Min_{th}} \times 100\%$$
    *   **Variable Definitions:** $S_i$ is the selected symptom; $W_i$ is its assigned weight; $S_{major}$ represents unselected major symptoms; $Min_{th}$ and $Max_{th}$ are the defined threshold bounds.
*   **B. Linguistic Severity Mapping**
    *   **Rule:** Assign output status based on the calculated percentage:
        *   **IF** ($P \geq 75\%$) **THEN** Very Severe/Malaria Confirmed.
        *   **IF** ($45\% \leq P < 75\%$) **THEN** Moderate/Needs Rest.
        *   **IF** ($P \approx 30\%$) **THEN** Mild/Normal Health Stage.

### **II. Advanced Overlap and Atypical Symptom Logic (Layer 2)**
*   **A. The "Insidious Overlap" Rule**
    *   **Inference Logic:** IF (Patient = Suspected Malaria) AND (Symptoms = Persistent cough) OR (Symptoms = Night sweats) OR (Symptoms = Coughing up blood) THEN **Weight:** Increase cross-evaluation for **Tuberculosis or Malaria-Typhoid co-infection**.
*   **B. Bitter Taste/Sour Lip Logic**
    *   **Rule:** IF (Symptom = Bitterness in the mouth) OR (Symptom = Sour lips) THEN **Action:** Add specific weight to the Malaria hypothesis.

### **III. Acute Seizure and Convulsion Management (Layer 3)**
*   **A. Pharmacological Intervention Logic**
    *   **Trigger:** IF (Malaria = Very Severe) AND (Status = Convulsing now) THEN **Action:** Administer **Diazepam**.
    *   **Dosing Logic (Rectal):** Give $0.5\text{ mg/kg}$ diazepam solution per rectum using a syringe without a needle.
    *   **Failure Protocol:** IF (Convulsions = Persist after 10 minutes) THEN **Action:** Repeat Diazepam dose and **Refer Urgently**.

### **IV. Alternative Therapeutic and Prophylactic Logic (Layer 4)**
*   **A. Specialized Drug Selection**
    *   **Rule 1 (Prophylaxis):** IF (Objective = Prophylaxis for high-risk traveler) THEN **Options:** Malarone (atovaquone-proguanil), Mefloquine (Lariam), or Doxycycline.
    *   **Rule 2 (Alternate Antimalarials):** IF (ACT = Unavailable) OR (Resistance = Known to local strains) THEN **Selection:** Consider Hydroxychloroquine, Quinine sulfate, or Atovaquone-proguanil.
*   **B. Quinine Dosing Refinement**
    *   **Rule:** IF (Treatment = IM Quinine) THEN **Action:** Use Quinine salt; the patient **must remain lying down for one hour** post-injection to monitor for adverse effects.

### **V. Metabolic Support and Hypoglycemia Logic (Layer 5)**
*   **A. Sugar Water Preparation Rule**
    *   **Trigger:** IF (Patient = Unable to swallow/Lethargic) THEN **Action:** Prevent low blood sugar.
    *   **Logic:** IF (Nasogastric tube = Available) THEN give $50\text{ ml}$ of sugar water; ELSE give 1 teaspoon of sugar moistened with 1-2 drops of water **sublingually**.
    *   **Mixing Rule:** Dissolve 4 level teaspoons of sugar ($20\text{ grams}$) in a $200\text{-ml}$ cup of clean water.

### **VI. Advanced Computational Inference (Layer 6)**
*   **A. Root Sum Square (RSS) Method**
    *   **Logic Rule:** Use the **RSS fuzzy method** to draw inferences from the knowledge base, providing more robust handling of overlapping tropical fever data than simple linear addition.
*   **B. Membership Function Optimization**
    *   **Rule:** Utilize **Triangular Membership Functions** to define the degree of participation for each malarial input variable (Temperature, Chills, Fatigue).

### **VII. Immunological Maturity and Exposure Logic (Layer 7)**
*   **A. Memory B-Cell Variable**
    *   **Inference Rule:** IF (Age < 5 years) AND (Area = High Endemicity) THEN **Probability:** High risk of severe outcomes due to lack of acquired immunity/Memory B-cell response.
    *   **Single-Dose Efficacy Rule:** IF (Age > 5 years) THEN **Action:** One dose of OCV/Antimalarial may show higher efficacy due to previous natural exposure and baseline immunity.
