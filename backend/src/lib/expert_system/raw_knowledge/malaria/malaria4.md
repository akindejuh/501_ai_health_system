This fourth logic tree for malaria focuses on **microscopic technique selection**, **treatment failure protocols**, **malnutrition-appetite interactions**, and **risk-based screening thresholds** not fully detailed in the previous trees.

### **I. Diagnostic Modality Selection Logic (Layer 1)**
*   **A. Smear Type Prioritization**
    *   **Rule 1 (Detection):** IF (Objective = Detect presence of parasites) THEN **Action:** Perform **Thick Blood Smear** (highest sensitivity for detection).
    *   **Rule 2 (Identification):** IF (Objective = Identify Plasmodium species) OR (Objective = Quantify parasitemia) THEN **Action:** Perform **Thin Blood Smear**.
*   **B. RDT vs. Microscopy Conflict**
    *   **Rule:** IF (RDT = Positive) AND (Microscopy = Available) THEN **Action:** Must confirm species and density via microscopy, as RDTs cannot quantify parasitemia or confirm all species.

### **II. Advanced Risk Stratification (Layer 2)**
*   **A. Malaria Risk Intensity Logic**
    *   **High-Risk Area Rule:** IF (Risk = High) AND (Fever = Present) THEN **Action:** Conduct malaria test in **all cases**, even if other causes are suspected.
    *   **Low-Risk Area Rule:** IF (Risk = Low) AND (Fever = Present) AND (Obvious cause of fever = Absent) THEN **Action:** Conduct malaria test.
    *   **No Risk Rule:** IF (Travel history to endemic zone = None) THEN **Action:** Evaluate for alternative febrile illnesses unless clinical suspicion remains high.

### **III. Management of Treatment Complications (Layer 3)**
*   **A. Immediate Post-Dose Vomiting Logic**
    *   **Rule (AL or AS+AQ):** IF (Child vomits within **one hour** of first dose) THEN **Action:** **Repeat the full dose** immediately.
*   **B. Nutritional Requirements**
    *   **Rule (Artemether-Lumefantrine):** IF (Treatment = AL) THEN **Requirement:** Instruct caregiver that the medication **must be taken with food** to ensure absorption.

### **IV. Follow-Up and Treatment Failure Logic (Layer 4)**
*   **A. Persistent Fever Protocol (48–72 Hours)**
    *   **Logic Rule:** IF (Fever persists after 3 days) AND (Initial RDT = Positive) THEN **Action:** **Do NOT repeat RDT** (RDTs can stay positive for weeks after clearance); perform **Microscopy** instead to check for live parasites.
*   **B. Identification of Resistance**
    *   **Logic Rule:** IF (Microscopy = Positive after full course) AND (Other fever causes = Absent) THEN **Classification:** Treatment Failure; **Action:** Initiate **second-line antimalarial** or refer to hospital.

### **V. Malnutrition and Appetite Interaction Logic (Layer 5)**
*   **A. The "Appetite Test" for Severe Cases**
    *   **Rule:** IF (Child has Severe Acute Malnutrition [SAM]) AND (General Danger Signs = Absent) THEN **Action:** Perform **Appetite Test** using Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF).
    *   **Referral Trigger:** IF (Child = Unable to finish RUTF portion within 30 minutes) THEN **Action:** **Urgent Referral** for Complicated SAM/Severe Malaria.

### **VI. Specific Pediatric Comorbidity Logic (Layer 6)**
*   **A. Measles Interaction**
    *   **Logic Rule:** IF (Child = Fever) AND (History = Measles within last 3 months) THEN **Inference:** High risk for severe complications; **Action:** Check for clouding of cornea and deep mouth ulcers.
*   **B. HIV Diagnostic Cutoffs**
    *   **Age Logic:**
        *   IF (Patient < 18 months) THEN **Action:** Use **Virological test (PCR)** (antibodies from mother may yield false positives).
        *   IF (Patient $\geq$ 18 months) THEN **Action:** Use **Serological test** for confirmation.

### **VII. Severe Malaria Specialized Dosing (Layer 7)**
*   **A. IM Quinine Schedule**
    *   **Loading Dose Logic:** IF (Severe Malaria) AND (Artesunate Unavailable) THEN **Action:** Give Quinine 20 mg/kg loading dose.
    *   **Maintenance Logic:** IF (Quinine initiated) THEN **Action:** Repeat doses at **4 and 8 hours**, then every **12 hours** until oral meds are tolerated.
*   **B. Safety Monitoring**
    *   **Post-Quinine Rule:** IF (Quinine injection given) THEN **Action:** Patient must remain **lying down for one hour** to monitor for hypotension or adverse reactions.
